# Job-Hunting-project
The Job Portal System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to connect job seekers and recruiters on a single digital platform. The main objective of this project is to simplify and streamline the job recruitment process by allowing users to post and apply for jobs with ease through a simple and responsive user interface.

The system provides two primary user roles — Recruiter and Applicant. Recruiters can create an account, log in to their dashboard, and post new job openings by specifying details such as job title, description, required qualifications, location, and salary range. They can also view the list of applicants who have applied for their posted jobs and manage applications efficiently. This feature eliminates the need for manual hiring processes and ensures quick access to potential candidates.

On the other hand, applicants can register on the platform, build and manage their profiles, upload resumes, and browse available job listings. They can filter jobs based on criteria such as category, location, and experience level, and apply directly through the portal. Applicants can also track their job applications and view status updates from recruiters, ensuring transparency throughout the recruitment cycle.

The Job Portal System features a clean and user-friendly interface that enhances the user experience. It includes a secure authentication system for login and registration, ensuring that user data is protected. The responsive design ensures that users can access the platform from any device — whether desktop, tablet, or mobile — without compromising functionality.

This project utilizes modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front end and PHP / Node.js / Python for the back end, with MySQL / MongoDB as the database.

Overall, the Job Portal System offers an efficient and organized way for employers and job seekers to connect, making the hiring process faster, smarter, and more convenient for all parties involved.
